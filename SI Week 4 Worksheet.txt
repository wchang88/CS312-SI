SI Week 4 Worksheet
Warm-up:
	Write a program that converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit for any 
	arbitrary temperature. Temperatures can be either be an integer or a double,
	just like in every day life.

	The following code skeleton has been provided for you. Do not change the 
	function names, but you can add to each methods parameter list. Then 
	complete the functions. Each of these methods should print out the original
	temperature and the converted temperature, with each number followed by 
	either 'F' or 'C' and separated with " = ".
	
	public class TemperatureConversion {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		}
		
		// converts Celsuis to Fahrenheit
		public static void toFahrenheit() {
			// TODO: complete the code for conversion
		}
		
		// converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
		public static void toCelsius() {
			// TODO: complete the code for conversion
		}
	}
	
Main Activity:
	(1) Using the two functions you just completed, for the next 10 temperatures
		starting from -10C and increasing by increments of 5 degrees, convert
		each temperature into Fahrenheit and print each of them out on a
		separate line.
		
	(2) Alice is performing an experiment. She wants to calculate the
		temperature of a pot that starts out as being x degrees F and warms up 
		at a rate of y degrees F after t seconds. She wants to test rates of 
		[5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20] and starting temperatures of [0, 24.5, 49, 73.5].
		For each rate and starting temperature, she wants to print out the
		temperature IN CELSIUS of the pot after 1-5 seconds. The output should
		be in the format below where x and y are the respective numbers:
		
		Starting temperature: xF
		Rate: yF per second
		<output from conversion>
		
		Rate: yF per second
		<output from conversion>
		.
		.
		.
		
		Starting temperature: xF
		Rate: yF per second
		.
		.
		.
		
	(3) A challenge for if you have time or want extra practice. Alice has
		decided that her program is very useful, but she wants to be able to
		use it for any starting temperature, for any rate, for any increment for
		the previous two variables. In other words, Alice wants to be able to 
		reuse the same code for different values without having to rewrite any 
		part of it. In addition, Alice wants this new program to calculate in
		batches of 5, meaning every time she runs this program with her values,
		it should calculate the pot's temperature for 5 starting temperatures,
		for 5 rates, and for 5 seconds (1-5). Turn your program from (2) into 
		one that satisfies Alice's description.

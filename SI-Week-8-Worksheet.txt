SI Week 8 Worksheet

Problem 1:
	You are given a file by your boss. The file is an ordinary text file called
	"data.txt". Your boss is being very picky about the way you are reading in
	data from the file and today they decided that you absolutely MUST use
	token-based processing. They will not accept anything else. You open the
	file and notice something peculiar about the file: the data is separated by
	the sequence "+--+"! Why? Who knows? You find it strange, but alas you gotta
	work with what you're given.
	
	The first part of your job is to set up a Scanner that will fulfil the 
	conditions set forth by your boss and allow you to read in the data. Please
	set up the Scanner before you move on.
	
	// Set up your Scanner here. Make sure that your Scanner will do
	// token-based processing and that the delimiter is correctly set
	
	The next part of your job is now to perform operations on the file. You take
	a more careful and detailed look at the file. You find that the first three
	lines of the file look like this:
	
		Hilda+--+Riegan+--+1909+--+May+--+31+--+1989+--+December+--+31
		Marianne+--+Edmund+--+1980+--+August+--+12+--+0000+--+Alive+--+00
		Felix+--+Hugo+--+1880+--+June+--+21+--+1935+--+July+--+1
		
	The entire file follows this format. The data is ordered as such: first
	name, last name, year of birth, month of birth, day of birth, year of 
	death, month of death, day of death. Your boss wants you to write a program
	that will print out the age of only the people who have passed away. The 
	output format is as such:
	
		<last name>, <first name> passed away at the age of <age> years old
		
	After you finish this program and submit it to your boss, your boss asks
	you for feedback. What two pieces of feedback would you give him?
		
Problem 2:
	Your friend asks you for help to set up a Scanner that will take user input.
	They tell you that they're writing a program that will ask the user for
	various pieces of information in order to do something. They have most of 
	the code already written, but they just don't know how to set up the
	Scanner. Can you set it up for them?
	
	// Set up your Scanner here
	
	As you take a look at your friend's code, you notice that not only is their
	code very messy, but there are a bunch of potential bugs in the code! You
	bring this up to your friend, but they just stare back at you in confusion.
	So you decide to show him an example. Their code outputs something like
	below to the user's screen:
	
		Input first name: <user input here>
		Input last name: <user input here>
		Input age: <user input here>
		Input occupation: <user input here>
		Input yearly income: <user input here>
		
		Your name is <first name> <last name>. You are <age> years old. You
		work in the <occupation> field and you earn $<income> a year.
		
	Their code calls Scanner methods in this order:
		first_name = sc.next();
		last_name = sc.nextLine();
		age = sc.nextInt();
		occupation = sc.nextLine();
		income = sc.nextDouble();
		
	You show him an example where the inputs are "Mary Sue", "Jones", "19", 
	"freelance writer", "90000", in that order. Where did your friend go wrong?
	What do you get if you tried to run the code as your friend had it? How
	would you fix it?
	
Extra Challenge!!
	Count how many commas appear in this file using a Scanner and print the
	number out. Good luck :,)

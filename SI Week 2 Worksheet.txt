What do the following expressions evaluate to?
1. 25 + 75 / 3 * 4 + "exp" + 35 / 5
2. (25 + 75) / 4 * (2 + 8) / 5
3. 38 % (6 / 4) + "mod" + ((10 % 3) * 8)

A: Sam and J are friends who like to compete to see who's taller. One day, Sam
   decides to boost their height by putting on stilts. After putting them on,
   Sam grew from 151.3 cm to 170.8 cm. J sees Sam and decides to copy Sam by
   putting on the same height stilts as Sam. If J was 151.8 cm before they put
   the stilts on, how tall are they after putting the stilts on? Print out the
   answer without doing any math by hand. 

   Suddenly, Sam and J find themselves in Wonderland. They find two curious 
   bottles, and they decide to try them (cuz why not?). After drinking the 
   bottles, Sam shrinks to half their original height! J on the other hand 
   grows an extra half of their original height. In both cases, their original 
   height is the height including the stilts. Print out the friends' new and 
   old heights. The format should be "Friend's-name has shrunk/grown from xxx 
   cm to xxx cm after drinking the bottle.", where Friend's-name is either Sam 
   or J, xxx is their height, and shrunk/grown is what happened to them.   


B: Alec is an ASCII art programmer. She wants to print out the following 
   hourglass:
   *************
   **         **
     **     **
	   *   *
	    * *
	   *   *
     **     **
   **         **
   *************
   Alec realizes that she can reduce repetition in her code. Write this program.
   
   Alec decides she wants to draw some more figures. Using the methods you 
   wrote for the hourglass, draw a bottle below the hourglass
   
	    * *
	    * *
	   *   *
     **     **
   **         **
   *************
   
   and an 8 below the bottle
   
   *************
   *************
   **         **
   *************
   **         **
   *************
   *************
   
   
C: Lucien, Lorein, and Luke are identical triplets. They love to play pranks on
   people by making them guess who's who. This time, they've invited their best
   friend Lorcan to play a game with them. In a room, they've placed 5 chairs.
   Lucien, Lorein, and Luke sit down in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th chairs 
   respectively. Now they ask Lorcan to turn around as the triplets swap seats.
   They swap chairs in such an order:
   
   Lucien and Lorein swap seats.
   Luke moves to seat 2.
   Lorein swaps seats with Luke.
   Lucien moves to seat 5.
   Lorein moves to seat 4.
   Lucien and Lorein swap seats.
   Luke moves to seat 3.
   Lucien moves to seat 1.
   Luke and Lorein swap seats.
   
   Now, Lorcan has extremely sharp hearing and so he can tell the difference
   between each of the triplets and where they are. But he doesn't have very
   good memory. Print out who's in what seat at each step above to help Lorcan
   remember. After the last swap, Lorcan turns around and confidently points 
   out which triplet was who. Print out what you think the triplet's reaction
   is.

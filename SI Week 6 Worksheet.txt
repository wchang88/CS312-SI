Week 6 SI Worksheet

Warmup:
	Given the following code, what is the result of each expression? Explain
	the reasoning for your answer.
		String s1 = "hello";
		String s2 = "hello";
		String s3 = s1;
		String s4 = "Hello";
		
	a) s1 == s2
	b) s1 == s3
	c) s2 == s3
	d) s1.equals(s2)
	e) s2.equals(s3)
	f) s4.equals(s3)
	
Main Activity:
	Given a user-inputted String s, print out some statistics for s. The 
	statistics we want to calculate are as follows:
		- the length of s
		- the first character in s
		- the last character in s
		- the middle character in s
		- two substrings of s divided around the middle character
		- if s contains numbers only
		- if s contains letters only
		- if s contains at least one letter and one number
		- if the substring of the first middle characters contains only numbers
		- if the substring of the first middle characters contains only letters
		- if the substring of the first middle characters contains a mix of 
		  letter and numbers
	
	You should print each statistic on its own line and with ample description 
	of what each statistic is (ex: for length, you can print 'The length of 
	the string "<insert s here>" is <length of string>').
	
	***All of these can be solved with the String methods we covered in lecture.
	If you need a refresher on String methods, refer to Topic 13's slides 11 and
	19.
		
	***Try to apply a procedural design to this program. If you don't remember
	what procedural design is, check Topic 13's slide 6 for a refresher.
	
	***Some of these statistics depend on other statistics. However, each
	statistic should be calculated EXACTLY ONCE. To do this, you will need to
	employ techniques learned in previous weeks.

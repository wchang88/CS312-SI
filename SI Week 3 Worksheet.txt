SI Week 3 Worksheet
Warm-up:
How many tildes ("~") are printed when this code executes?

	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		for (int j = i; j > 0; j--) {
			for (int k = i; k < 10; k++) {
				System.out.print("~");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}

A. 165  B. 220  C. 286  D. 275  E. 210

Main Activity:
(A)
The famous Fibonacci numbers has a closely related sibling, the Lucas numbers.
Like the Fibonacci numbers, each successive Lucas number can be found by adding
the previous two terms together. The only difference between Fibonacci numbers
and Lucas numbers are their starting points. For the Lucas sequence, the first
number is 2 and the second number is 1. Using loops, find the next 10 Lucas 
numbers. Print out the first 12 Lucas numbers (the first and second numbers
plus the 10 you calculated) in a single line. You can find out more about the
Lucas numbers at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number

(B)
Another interesting number is the hexagonal numbers. There's a Wikipedia page
about these numbers - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_number - if you're
interested in learning more about them. For this problem, all you need to know
is that the nth hexagonal number is calculated as n(2n - 1). Using loops, find
the first 10 hexagonal numbers. Print each number on its own line in the format
"For n = ..., the hexagonal number is ...", replacing each of the ... with the
appropriate numbers.
